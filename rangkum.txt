5 Reasons Why Catizen is the Leading Game in TON Ecosystem

While other developers rushed to create clicker games after the TON explosion,

 laid the groundwork in the TON ecosystem 1.5 years in advance, then elegantly succeeded with their hit game.

Here are 5 key reasons why Catizen surpasses competitors in all aspects:

1. Game Design (A hit game can unlock a rewarding system with positive externality)

While others were merely making clickers, Catizen was ready to build an entire empire from day one. It took their team four to five months to go from selecting a promising prototype to Catizen's actual launch. 

A fun gameplay is the foundation. 

Catizen's flywheel works like this: Fun - Users - Cash Flow - Partnerships - More Value Rewarding Users and the Ecosystem.

2. Monetization (Web2+3 model for profitability, sustainability, and value-sharing)

Players spend money to buy Fish Coins for fishing (Gacha mechanic), or purchase discounted goods and automated tools from the Store - monetization models familiar to Web2 gamers.

Starting from solid monetization and revenue, Catizen became the only Web3 company building a TON mini-game earning revenue over $12M among all gaming projects in the space.
                  Catizen combined classic Web2 monetization with Web3 launchpools & airdrops, creating massive value for the TON ecosystem, partners (like Mentle), and their players (who received airdrops of NOT and TON tokens).

Through the Web2+3 monetization approach, they achieved three milestones:
- Obtained users with spending power who could potentially adopt crypto;
- Opened a new market of TON gamers, beyond just airdrop farmers;
- Educated users on a long-term Web3 engagement loop: spend - play - Gacha - receive multiple rewarding airdrops across different assets.

                 3. Operational Capabilities (Ensure it continuously attracts attention, grows users, and scales)

Operations are key to sustaining long-term engagement - a testament to the team's commitment. Catizen deeply understands Web3 culture, partnerships, and leverages operational experience from Web2.

Two classic examples are:
- NPCs: Including memes like Pepe or partners' mascots like TON (randomly boosting profits/airdrops/Cat amounts);
- Meow Spin: An activity that gets users more Gocha chances by inviting friends, with rewards ranging from partnership token drops (xZEN) to in-game items;

                 Delivering a game is easy; maintaining growth and user stickiness through operations is hard.

Catizen isn't a one-hit wonder that fades away - it continually provides user benefits through its operations.

4. Voice on Social Media:

Most gaming teams lack the basic ability to operate social media and grow organic traction. They either rely on NFT marketing with high-quality graphics or depend on "guilds" for more exposure, simply "copying" and "pasting" marketing tactics with barely any active users. 

However, Catizen pioneered its own approach by running their Twitter like a cat-lover TikTok account. They make funny videos, use tons of cat meme images, and often comment on well-known tweets. These things are naturally attractive, and people stay and follow the Twitter regardless of whether they're players.
Now, with over 1.2 million on-chain users and a total of 21 million registered users, Catizen no longer needs to prove how popular they are.

Memes are just the surface; behind them is a professional growth and PR team. If you noticed they announced they would use 1% of their profits to rescue stray cats, you know they have far bigger plans in store.

                 5. Hit Content Pipeline (It is no fluke, and the success can continue)

The dev team behind Catizen has been developing mini-games since 2018 and has created over 20 hit titles, amassing over 300 million downloads on WeChat, Google Play, and Facebook Gaming.

For new TON game developers, it takes time to figure out how to find product-market fit, build the infrastructure, and acquire users.

However, Catizen has a pipeline of 200 games. We can expect them to rapidly leverage their existing user base, raising the bar higher with each release for all gaming audiences on TON - making truly exceptional games increasingly difficult to develop. 

Beyond gaming, Catizen and its parent company also have short-form video content and e-commerce offerings ready to go.
